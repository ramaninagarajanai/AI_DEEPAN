1. Include the varspeedservomaster library in your arduino software.
2. Note that I have connected servo motors of the biped based on the biped prespective. 
   That is for example RU -> Right Upper servo motor ( right leg of the biped).
3. Download AMR_voice app from play store.
4. Upload the code in the arduino, connect your mobile phone witht the HC-05(Bluetooth-Module). 
5. You are ready to go!! An awesome walking robot.
