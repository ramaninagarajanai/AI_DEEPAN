An automatic Street lamp that controls illumination of the street lamp when needed.

Components used:
1. IR Sensor   x2
2. Arduino UNO x2
3. HC-05       x2
4. Leds 


Note: I have included extra logic, that is nothing but a swtich to swtich on this mode.

Bluetooth to bluetooth communication happens only when it is paired. 

Upload the code in two arduinos and it will run perfectly.
